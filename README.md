Becareful about this specific case 5(5) = False can't be calculated you have to type 5*(5) = 25 , 
but you still can do -(5) = -5 , instead of -1*(5)

NOTE1: my eval() Now can't calculate the complex (imaginary number) !!
Be careful of exponentiating negative numbers with numbers lower than 1 ; example (-2)^0.87 !!! 

NOTE2: if you want to exponent a number use ^ as ** example; 5^2 = 25 , 5^-2 = 0.04 , 5^-(-2) = 25 etc.

Example:

good;

1+1   //
1--1   //
-(-5)   //
2^3   //
2^(-1/3) , 2^-1   //
1+-2   //
(((1712/10)-(-(19+8/11*(13/9-(8/716))/6))+22)-(10*(16/13+14/8))-(11*(20/15-(13/7))))+(15*(21/18-(11/12^-7)))

bad;

1++1 (1+1 is enough bro)   //
1-+2 (why don't you just type 1-2 lmao)   //
(any negative number)^(number lower than one) --> (-5)^0.25   //
3^3^3^3 { if you really want to do this pls type 3^((3^3)^3) something like this, but you know that the anwser is massive af }   //
1/0 (!!!!)
