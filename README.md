Becareful about this specific case 5(5) = False can't be calculated you have to type 5*(5) = 25 , 
but you still can do -(5) = -5 , instead of -1*(5)
NOTE: my eval() Now can't calculate the complex (imaginary number) !!
Be careful of exponentiating negative numbers with numbers lower than 1 ; example (-2)^0.87 !!!
