Becareful about this specific case 5(5) = False can't be calculated you have to type 5*(5) = 25 , 
but you still can do -(5) = -5 , instead of -1*(5)

NOTE1: my eval() Now can't calculate the complex (imaginary number) !!
Be careful of exponentiating negative numbers with numbers lower than 1 ; example (-2)^0.87 !!! 

NOTE2: Beware of dividing by zero, because now I'm lazy to prevent that case TT

NOTE3: if you want to exponent a number use ^ as ** example; 5^2 = 25 , 5^-2 = 0.04 , 5^-(-2) = 25 etc.
